# Kaustuv Singh

Product-first technologist | AI • IoT • Autonomous Systems • Web Platforms

I build and ship real systems — not just academic exercises.  
My work spans healthcare tech, civic platforms, autonomous engineering, and campus-scale products, with a strong focus on execution, ownership, and impact.

## 🚀 What I Do

I work at the intersection of **deep tech and real-world problems**.  
My projects are typically end-to-end: problem framing → architecture → build → iteration → pitch or launch.

I am especially interested in systems that operate under constraints — time, scale, real users, or real-world environments.

## 🏆 Highlights

- **National Finalist (Top 3), IIT Kharagpur** — *HealthQueue*  
  AI-driven hospital queue & patient-flow optimization system, evaluated at a national platform with quantified impact metrics.

- **National Finalist, IIT Kharagpur Aeromodelling Competition**  
  Worked on aircraft design, stability, control, and performance optimization under strict engineering constraints.

- **Institute Winner, Smart India Hackathon 2025** — *Jan Samadhan*  
  Civic-issue reporting and resolution platform, led through problem framing, architecture, and coordination.

- **Founder & Builder — CampusXchange**  
  A fully live, student-only campus marketplace with real users, payments, and delivery coordination.  
  Built as a real product — not a classroom assignment.
